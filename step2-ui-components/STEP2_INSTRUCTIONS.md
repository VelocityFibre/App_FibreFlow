# Step 2: Copy Safe UI Components

## What you're copying:
4 standalone UI components that enhance your app without breaking existing functionality.

## Files to copy:
```
ActionButton.tsx       - Reusable action buttons with loading states
LazyComponents.tsx     - Code splitting utilities for performance  
ModuleOverviewCard.tsx - Overview cards for modules
ModuleOverviewLayout.tsx - Layout wrapper for overview pages
```

## Copy commands:
```bash
# Navigate to your original project components directory
cd /home/ldp/louisdup/Clients/VelocityFibre/App/FibreFlow/project-management-app/FibreFlow/src/components/

# Copy the 4 files
cp /home/ldp/louisdup/Clients/VelocityFibre/App/Hein/App_FibreFlow/step2-ui-components/*.tsx .
```

## What these components do:

### ActionButton.tsx
- Enhanced button component with loading states
- Consistent styling across the app
- Built-in accessibility features

### LazyComponents.tsx  
- Code splitting utilities for better performance
- Lazy loading of heavy components
- Reduces initial bundle size

### ModuleOverviewCard.tsx
- Card component for displaying module information
- Consistent design for overview pages
- Click handling and navigation

### ModuleOverviewLayout.tsx
- Layout wrapper for module overview pages
- Grid system for cards
- Responsive design

## Testing:
After copying, your app should still work normally. These components are available for use but won't automatically change existing functionality.

## Next step:
Once copied, we'll move to Step 3 (Performance utilities).
