  - Phase completion notifications to stakeholders
  - Budget threshold alerts
  - Resource conflict notifications
  - Client update triggers

### **5. Staff & Resource Management**

  - Admin (system-wide configuration)

- **Staff Assignment System**
  - Primary and secondary assignees per task
  - Skill-based task matching
  - Workload balancing across team members
  - Availability calendar integration
  - Subcontractor management

### **6. Communication & Collaboration**

  - Task-level commenting system
  - @mention notifications
  - Team chat integration
  - File sharing and version control
  - Meeting scheduling and notes

- **Client Communication**
  - Automated progress reports
  - Client portal with real-time updates
  - Milestone achievement notifications
  - Issue escalation alerts
  - Approval request workflows

### **7. Reporting & Analytics**
