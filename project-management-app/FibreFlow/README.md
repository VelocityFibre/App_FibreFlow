# FiberFlow - Enterprise Fiber Project Management System

## ðŸš€ **THE CORE FOCUS: Advanced 4-Level Project Hierarchy**

FiberFlow is an enterprise-grade project management system specifically designed for fiber optic infrastructure deployment. At its core is a sophisticated **4-level hierarchical structure** (Projects â†’ Phases â†’ Steps â†’ Tasks) with industry-specific workflows, drag-and-drop management, and comprehensive automation.

### **ðŸŽ¯ Primary Mission**
Transform fiber project management through an intelligent hierarchical system that manages the complete lifecycle from planning to final acceptance, reducing project completion time by 20% and improving on-time delivery to 95%.

### **ðŸ“Š Core Hierarchy System**
```
Projects (Fiber Deployments)
â”œâ”€â”€ Phases (6 Industry Standards: Planning, IP, WIP, Handover, HOC, FAC)
    â”œâ”€â”€ Steps (Civils, Optical, Testing, Documentation)
        â””â”€â”€ Tasks (Pole Permissions, Trenching, Cable Laying, etc.)
```

## Supabase Backend

All backend/database operations are performed using [Supabase](https://supabase.com/). The app uses Supabase's RESTful API for all CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) across all entities (projects, customers, materials, etc.).

---

## Branch Protection & Contribution Workflow

- **Main branch is protected:** Direct pushes to `main` are not allowed.
- **Pull requests required:** All changes must be made via a pull request from a feature or fix branch.
- **Code review required:** At least one approval is required before merging.
- **Status checks:** If enabled, at least one status check (such as CI or tests) must pass before merging. If you see an error like `Required status checks cannot be empty`, either select a status check or disable the rule (see Troubleshooting below).
- **Linear history recommended:** All merges should be done via rebase or squash for a clean commit history.

---

## Troubleshooting: Status Checks

If you see the error:

```
Required status checks cannot be empty. Please add at least one status check or disable the rule.
```

This means the branch protection rule "Require status checks to pass before merging" is enabled, but no status checks are configured. To resolve:
- Add a status check (e.g., GitHub Actions workflow) and select it in the rule; **or**
- Disable the "Require status checks" option in the branch protection settings.

## **ðŸ¤– AI-Ready Project Management Architecture**

### **Making FiberFlow Work Perfectly with AI Assistants**

FiberFlow is being designed from the ground up to work seamlessly with AI assistants like Claude, ChatGPT, and future AI tools. This isn't just about adding AI features - it's about building a system that AI can understand, interact with, and enhance.

#### **The Simple Value Proposition**
Instead of building just another project management tool, we're building one that **works perfectly with AI assistants**:
- **AI can actually help** manage projects (not just chat about them)
- **Fewer project failures** through smart guardrails
- **Less manual oversight** needed from managers
- **Faster issue resolution** with AI assistance

#### **Core AI-Ready Features**

1. **Clear Rules Instead of Vague Guidelines**
   - Explicit business rules AI can enforce
   - Structured workflows AI can monitor
   - Automatic alerts when rules are violated

2. **Structured Data That AI Can Read**
   - All project data in AI-friendly formats
   - Standardized status enums and field types
   - Clear relationships between entities

3. **Built-in Safety Checks**
   - Validation rules prevent invalid states
   - Business logic constraints enforced at database level
   - AI can't accidentally break critical workflows

#### **Practical Example**
```
Without AI-Ready Design:
Manager: "Claude, what's the status of the fiber rollout in Cape Town?"
Claude: "I don't have access to your project data."

With AI-Ready Design:
Manager: "Claude, what's the status of the fiber rollout in Cape Town?"
Claude: "The Cape Town project is 87% complete. Current blocker: Permit approval 
delayed by 3 days. I've identified 2 similar past projects where we fast-tracked 
permits - would you like me to apply those lessons?"
```

See [`AI-READY-GUIDE.md`](./AI-READY-GUIDE.md) for complete implementation details.

## **ðŸš€ GraphRAG Intelligence System - Next Major Feature**

**Absolutely! GraphRAG could be incredibly beneficial for your FiberFlow project management app.** This system will transform your project intelligence capabilities by creating a knowledge graph from your project data and enabling natural language queries.

### **How GraphRAG Transforms FiberFlow**

#### **Current Capabilities:**
- Projects, phases, tasks in relational database
- Basic reporting and analytics dashboard
- Standard queries like "show all active projects"

#### **GraphRAG Enhanced Capabilities:**
- **Complex Relationship Queries**: "Which projects share similar resource constraints as the delayed Cape Town deployment?"
- **Intelligent Insights**: "What factors typically lead to fiber installation delays based on historical patterns?"
- **Natural Language Interface**: Users ask questions in plain English, get AI-powered answers
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify success patterns and risk factors across project history
- **Predictive Analytics**: Early warning systems for potential project issues

### **FiberFlow-Specific Use Cases**

#### **1. Project Intelligence & Pattern Recognition**
```
User Query: "Why are our Johannesburg projects consistently delayed?"

GraphRAG Response: "Analysis shows Johannesburg projects are delayed due to three factors: 
municipal permit delays (average 2 weeks), material shortages affecting contractor efficiency, 
and seasonal weather patterns during Q2-Q3 affecting outdoor installations."
```

#### **2. Resource Optimization**
```
User Query: "Which teams should I assign to the new Durban fiber rollout?"

GraphRAG Response: "Team Alpha (led by Sarah) excels in coastal installations with 95% 
on-time completion. They successfully completed similar projects in Port Elizabeth and East London."
```

#### **3. Risk Prediction & Mitigation**
```
User Query: "What risks should I watch for in the upcoming Pretoria project?"

GraphRAG Response: "Similar projects show high correlation between underground utilities 
conflicts and 3-week delays. Projects in established suburbs require additional utility mapping."
```

### **Implementation Roadmap**

#### **Phase 1: Knowledge Graph Foundation (Week 1)**
- Set up Neo4j database integration with Supabase
- Create LLM entity extraction for projects, tasks, locations, teams, materials
- Transform existing project data into knowledge graph format
- Define node types: Project, Location, Team, Task, Material, Issue, Stakeholder
- Define relationships: LOCATED_AT, ASSIGNED_TO, DEPENDS_ON, CAUSED_BY, RESOLVED_BY

#### **Phase 2: Natural Language Query Interface (Week 2)**
- Create Cypher query generation for project management questions
- Build few-shot prompts for fiber optic project domain
- Integrate with existing dashboard for natural language search
- Enable intelligent project queries and recommendations

#### **Phase 3: Intelligent Insights & Predictions (Week 3)**
- Implement pattern recognition across project history
- Create predictive analytics using graph relationships
- Build automated risk assessment based on project similarities
- Generate optimization recommendations for resource allocation
- Add intelligent project planning assistance

### **Expected ROI & Benefits**

#### **For Project Managers:**
- **40-60% faster project planning** with AI-powered recommendations
- **Risk prediction** with early warning systems
- **Data-driven resource allocation** based on proven success patterns

#### **For Field Teams:**
- **Contextual guidance**: "Projects like this usually require X, Y, Z"
- **Intelligent troubleshooting**: "Similar issues were resolved by..."
- **Best practices** automatically suggested based on successful projects

#### **For Executives:**
- **Strategic insights** through pattern analysis across all projects
- **Performance analytics** explaining regional/team performance differences
- **Investment planning** with data-driven expansion recommendations

### **Technical Integration Strategy**

The GraphRAG system will integrate seamlessly with your existing:
- âœ… **Performance Infrastructure**: React Query handles complex GraphRAG queries efficiently
- âœ… **Feature Flags**: Safe rollout of GraphRAG features
- âœ… **Analytics Dashboard**: Natural language query interface

## ðŸ¤– Claude Code Development Patterns

### Optimized for AI-Assisted Development

FibreFlow follows specific patterns optimized for development with Claude Code and other AI assistants:

#### **Quick Start for Claude Code**
When starting a session, always provide this context:
```
I'm working on FibreFlow with these constraints:
- Stack: Next.js + Supabase + Tailwind + React Query
- Performance: < 50ms response times required
- All new features need feature flags
- Current performance: 92-93% optimized
```

#### **Binary Rules for Consistency**
- **ALWAYS**: Use React Query for server state, include TypeScript types, test with feature flags OFF
- **NEVER**: Use useState for server data, skip error boundaries, expose internal IDs

#### **Clear Success Criteria**
Every feature must meet:
- âœ… Response time < 50ms
- âœ… Works with feature flag OFF
- âœ… Includes error handling
- âœ… TypeScript types complete
- âœ… Follows existing patterns

See [`CLAUDE-ENGINEERING-GUIDE.md`](./CLAUDE-ENGINEERING-GUIDE.md) for complete prompt engineering principles and [`DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`](./DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md) for Claude-optimized patterns.
