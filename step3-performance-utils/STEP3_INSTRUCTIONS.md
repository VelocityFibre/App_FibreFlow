# Step 3: Copy Performance & Utility Libraries

## What you're copying:
4 utility libraries that enhance performance and provide helpful functions.

## Files to copy:
```
performance-monitor.ts - Performance tracking and monitoring
rateLimiter.ts        - Rate limiting for API calls  
queryHelpers.ts       - Database query optimization helpers
dynamicImports.ts     - Dynamic import utilities for code splitting
```

## Copy commands:
```bash
# Navigate to your original project lib directory
cd /home/ldp/louisdup/Clients/VelocityFibre/App/FibreFlow/project-management-app/FibreFlow/src/lib/

# Copy the 4 utility files
cp /home/ldp/louisdup/Clients/VelocityFibre/App/Hein/App_FibreFlow/step3-performance-utils/*.ts .
```

## What these utilities do:

### performance-monitor.ts
- Tracks page load times and component render performance
- Memory usage monitoring
- Provides performance metrics for optimization
- Can be used to identify bottlenecks

### rateLimiter.ts  
- Prevents API abuse by limiting request frequency
- Configurable rate limits per endpoint
- Protects against spam and overuse
- Essential for production environments

### queryHelpers.ts
- Optimizes database queries
- Provides reusable query patterns
- Reduces duplicate query logic
- Improves database performance

### dynamicImports.ts
- Utilities for lazy loading components
- Reduces initial bundle size
- Improves page load performance
- Code splitting helpers

## Testing:
After copying, your app should continue working normally. These utilities are available for use but won't automatically change existing functionality.

## Benefits:
- Better performance monitoring
- Protection against API abuse  
- Optimized database queries
- Improved code splitting

## Next step:
Once copied, we'll move to Step 4 (Soft Delete System).
