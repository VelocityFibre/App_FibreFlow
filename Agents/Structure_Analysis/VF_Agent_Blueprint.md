- **Future-Proofing:** Modular design allows swapping components (e.g., replacing OpenAI with alternative LLMs) with minimal disruption
- **Scalability by Design:** Infrastructure components selected for their ability to scale with usage

### 3. Business Empowerment
- **Natural Language Development:** Leverage Claude, Windsurf, and OpenAI Codex to enable agent creation through guided conversation
- **Controlled Innovation:** Maintain governance while allowing customization within guardrails
- **Resource Optimization:** Redeploy technical talent to high-value innovation rather than repetitive implementation

## Technical Architecture
