## Phase Progression Conditions

### Project Phase Progression
1. **Planning → Design**
   - All planning deliverables must be marked as complete
   - Budget approval must be obtained
   - Resource allocation must be confirmed
   - Progression requires Project Manager approval

2. **Design → Permitting**
   - All design documents must be finalized
   - Technical review must be completed with no critical issues
   - Customer sign-off on design must be obtained
   - Progression requires Design Lead approval

3. **Permitting → Construction**
   - All required permits must be obtained
   - Right-of-way agreements must be finalized
   - Construction schedule must be approved
   - Progression requires Permit Coordinator approval

4. **Construction → Testing**
   - All construction tasks must be marked as complete
   - As-built documentation must be uploaded
   - Quality control inspection must be passed
   - Progression requires Construction Manager approval

5. **Testing → Activation**
   - All testing procedures must pass
   - Test results documentation must be uploaded
   - Customer premises equipment must be installed
   - Progression requires Network Engineer approval

6. **Activation → Maintenance**
   - Service activation must be confirmed
   - Customer acceptance must be documented
   - Billing information must be updated
   - Progression requires Operations Manager approval

### Automated Phase Progression Checks
- System will automatically check completion criteria every 24 hours
- Notification will be sent to approver when all criteria are met
- Manual override requires management level permission and documented reason
- Failed checks will generate detailed reports of missing requirements

## Task Dependency Logic

### Task Dependency Types
1. **Finish-to-Start (FS)**: Task B cannot start until Task A is complete
2. **Start-to-Start (SS)**: Task B cannot start until Task A has started
3. **Finish-to-Finish (FF)**: Task B cannot finish until Task A is complete
4. **Start-to-Finish (SF)**: Task B cannot finish until Task A has started
5. **Lag Dependencies**: Task B starts X days after Task A completes

### Dependency Rules
- Circular dependencies are strictly prohibited and will be automatically detected
- Dependencies across project phases require management approval
- Critical path tasks have priority allocation of resources
- Dependencies can be marked as "soft" (warning) or "hard" (enforced)
- Maximum dependency chain length is limited to 10 tasks for performance reasons

### Dependency Automation
- System will automatically calculate earliest start dates based on dependencies
- Task status changes will trigger recalculation of dependent task schedules
- Dependency conflicts will be flagged for project manager resolution
- Gantt chart visualization will highlight dependency relationships

## Notification Triggers

### System-Generated Notifications
1. **Task Assignment**
   - Trigger: When a task is assigned to a staff member
   - Recipients: Assigned staff member, Project Manager
   - Channels: In-app, Email
   - Frequency: Immediate

2. **Task Due Date Approaching**
   - Trigger: 48 hours before task due date if not complete
   - Recipients: Assigned staff member
   - Channels: In-app, Email
   - Frequency: Once at 48 hours, again at 24 hours

3. **Task Overdue**
   - Trigger: When task passes due date without completion
   - Recipients: Assigned staff member, Project Manager
   - Channels: In-app, Email
   - Frequency: Daily until resolved

4. **Phase Progression Ready**
   - Trigger: When all criteria for phase progression are met
   - Recipients: Phase approver, Project Manager
   - Channels: In-app, Email
   - Frequency: Once, with reminder after 48 hours if no action

5. **Approval Required**
   - Trigger: When a deliverable requires approval
   - Recipients: Designated approver
   - Channels: In-app, Email
   - Frequency: Once, with reminder after 48 hours if no action

6. **Dependency Blocked**
   - Trigger: When a task cannot start due to incomplete dependencies
   - Recipients: Project Manager, assigned staff member
   - Channels: In-app
   - Frequency: Once when blocked status begins

7. **Resource Conflict**
   - Trigger: When staff is assigned overlapping tasks
   - Recipients: Project Manager, affected staff member
   - Channels: In-app, Email
   - Frequency: Once when conflict is detected

### Notification Rules
- All notifications must be debounced with a 5-minute interval
- Users can customize notification preferences (except for critical notifications)
- Notifications will include direct links to relevant items
- Bulk operations will generate a single summarized notification
- Notification history will be maintained for 90 days

## Approval Gate Specifications

### Approval Types
1. **Document Approval**
   - Required for: Design documents, As-built documentation, Test results
   - Approvers: Technical Lead, Project Manager, or Customer (as specified)
   - Timeout: 72 hours (escalation if no response)
   - Documentation: Version history, approval timestamp, approver identity

2. **Phase Progression Approval**
   - Required for: All phase transitions
   - Approvers: As specified in Phase Progression Conditions
   - Timeout: 48 hours (escalation if no response)
   - Documentation: Completion checklist, approval timestamp, approver identity

3. **Budget Amendment Approval**
   - Required for: Any change to project budget > 5%
   - Approvers: Finance Manager, Project Director
   - Timeout: 96 hours (escalation if no response)
   - Documentation: Original budget, requested change, justification, approval details

4. **Schedule Change Approval**
   - Required for: Any change to milestone dates
   - Approvers: Project Manager, Customer Representative
   - Timeout: 72 hours (escalation if no response)
   - Documentation: Original dates, new dates, impact analysis, approval details

5. **Resource Allocation Approval**
   - Required for: Assignment of resources across projects
   - Approvers: Resource Manager, Project Manager
   - Timeout: 48 hours (escalation if no response)
   - Documentation: Resource requirements, allocation details, approval timestamp

### Approval Workflow
1. Requestor submits item for approval
2. System notifies designated approver(s)
3. Approver reviews and takes action (approve/reject/request changes)
4. System records decision and timestamps
5. System notifies relevant parties of outcome
6. If timeout occurs, system escalates to next level approver

### Multi-Level Approval Rules
- Sequential approvals must follow defined hierarchy
- Parallel approvals require all approvers to approve independently
- Rejection at any level terminates approval process and returns to requestor
- Comments are required for rejections
- Approval history is maintained for audit purposes

## Feature Flag Controls

### Workflow Automation Feature Flags
1. **AutoProgressPhases**
   - Controls whether phases can progress automatically when criteria are met
   - Default: Disabled (requires manual approval)

2. **AutoAssignTasks**
   - Controls whether tasks are automatically assigned based on role and workload
   - Default: Disabled (requires manual assignment)

3. **PredictiveScheduling**
   - Controls whether AI-based schedule predictions are enabled
   - Default: Disabled (confidence threshold: 0.70)

4. **RealTimeNotifications**
   - Controls whether real-time WebSocket notifications are enabled
   - Default: Enabled (with HTTP fallback)

5. **ApprovalTimeout**
   - Controls whether approval timeout and escalation is active
   - Default: Enabled

### Feature Flag Implementation
- All workflow automation features must be implemented behind feature flags
- Feature flags can be toggled at system or project level
- Changes to feature flag settings require admin permission
- Feature flag status must be logged with all automated actions

## Performance Considerations

### Workflow Automation Performance Requirements
1. All automation rule evaluations must complete in < 50ms
2. Batch processing should be used for rules affecting > 100 items
3. Notification processing must not block user interactions
4. Dependency calculations should be cached and incrementally updated
5. Rule evaluations should be scheduled during low-usage periods when possible

### Monitoring and Optimization
1. Performance metrics will be collected for all rule evaluations
2. Rules exceeding performance thresholds will be flagged for optimization
3. Database queries for rule evaluation should be optimized with proper indexing
4. Complex rule evaluations should be processed asynchronously when possible
5. Memory usage for rule processing should not exceed 76MB
