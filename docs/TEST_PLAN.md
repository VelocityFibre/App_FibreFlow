## Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the FibreFlow application, a Next.js 14 fiber optic infrastructure management system. The test plan covers various testing levels including unit, integration, end-to-end, and performance testing to ensure the application meets all functional and non-functional requirements.

### Objectives
- Verify that all components work as expected individually and together
- Ensure the application meets performance targets (sub-50ms response times and ~76MB memory usage)
- Validate that the application is secure, accessible, and user-friendly
- Establish a reliable automated testing framework for continuous integration

### Scope
This test plan covers all modules of the FibreFlow application including:
- Project Management
- Task Management
- Customer Management
- Location Management
- Analytics Dashboard
- Audit Trail System
