Looking at your FiberFlow project, adding Power BI-like functionality is definitely feasible and would be a great addition! However, it's too complex to fit effectively on a single page - you'll want to break it into multiple focused views.

## Recommended Dashboard Structure

### 1. Executive Dashboard (Main Overview)
- High-level KPIs: active projects, completion rates, budget utilization
- Key charts: project timeline heatmap, resource allocation, cost trends
- Alert cards: overdue projects, inventory shortages, budget overruns

### 2. Project Analytics Page
- Project performance metrics and comparisons
- Gantt chart overlays with actual vs planned timelines
- Phase completion rates and bottleneck analysis
- Interactive filters by location, project manager, date ranges

### 3. Resource & Materials Intelligence
- Inventory turnover analysis and stock optimization
- Staff utilization rates and workload distribution  
- Material cost trends and supplier performance
- Predictive analytics for material needs

### 4. Operational Reports
- Site-level performance comparisons
- Task efficiency metrics and time tracking
- Quality metrics and rework analysis
- Custom report builder for stakeholders

## Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1: Core Analytics**
Start with essential charts using libraries like Recharts or Chart.js:
```typescript
// Example: Project completion trend component
const ProjectCompletionChart = () => {
  const { data } = useQuery(['project-analytics'], fetchProjectMetrics);
  
  return (
    <ResponsiveContainer width="100%" height={300}>
      <LineChart data={data}>
        <XAxis dataKey="month" />
        <YAxis />
        <Line dataKey="completedProjects" stroke="#8884d8" />
        <Line dataKey="plannedProjects" stroke="#82ca9d" />
      </LineChart>
    </ResponsiveContainer>
  );
};
```

**Phase 2: Interactive Features**
- Drill-down capabilities (click project bar to see phase details)
- Dynamic filtering and cross-filtering between charts
- Real-time data updates via Supabase subscriptions

**Phase 3: Advanced Analytics**
- AI-powered insights using your existing task sequencing AI
- Predictive models for project delays and resource needs
- Custom dashboard builder for different user roles

## Why Multiple Pages Work Better

**User Experience**: Different stakeholders need different views - executives want high-level trends, project managers need detailed task analytics, and site supervisors need operational metrics.

**Performance**: Complex dashboards with many charts can slow down significantly. Focused pages load faster and provide better interactivity.

**Mobile Responsiveness**: Your existing responsive design will work better with focused dashboard pages rather than cramming everything onto one screen.

**Role-Based Access**: Different user roles (Admin, Project Manager, Site Supervisor) can have tailored analytics views matching their responsibilities.

Given your existing Supabase setup and Next.js architecture, you could start with a main analytics dashboard and expand from there. The data structure you already have (projects, phases, tasks, materials) provides excellent foundation for meaningful business intelligence.
