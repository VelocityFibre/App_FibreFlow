### 2. Add Virtualization for Large Lists
**Status**: ⏸️ DEFERRED - Start Simple, Add Later  
**Effort**: Medium (2-3 days)  
**Impact**: High - Major performance improvement

#### 📝 **Decision Notes** (May 30, 2025):
**Current Scale**: Only 10 projects in system  
**Decision**: Skip virtualization for now, implement simple rendering  
**Threshold**: Add virtualization when reaching 50-100+ projects  
**Rationale**: Avoid premature optimization, focus on core hierarchy functionality

#### Tasks (Future Implementation):
- [ ] Install react-window or react-virtualized
- [ ] Implement on Projects page (when >100 items)
- [ ] Implement on Grid/DataTable component
- [ ] Implement on Audit Logs page
- [ ] Add loading indicators for virtualized lists

#### Simple Implementation for Now:
```typescript
// Start with basic rendering for 10 projects
const ProjectList = () => {
  const { data: projects } = useProjects();
  return (
    <div className="space-y-4">
      {projects?.map(project => (
        <ProjectCard key={project.id} project={project} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### Priority Pages (for future virtualization):
1. `/projects` - Can have 1000s of projects
2. `/grid` - Displays entire tables
3. `/admin/audit-logs` - Grows indefinitely
4. `/kanban` - Many tasks across phases

**Files to modify** (when implementing later):
- `project-management-app/src/app/projects/page.tsx`
