## üöÄ How to Copy to Your Project

### 1. Copy the Planning Page
```bash
# Navigate to your upgraded original project
cd /home/ldp/louisdup/Clients/VelocityFibre/App/FibreFlow/project-management-app/FibreFlow/

# Create planning directory
mkdir -p src/app/planning

# Copy the planning page
cp /home/ldp/louisdup/Clients/VelocityFibre/App/Hein/App_FibreFlow/step6-satellite-planning/page.tsx src/app/planning/
```
